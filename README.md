### Stop paying to set prices on variable products. Seriously.

## âœ¨ What it does
- If your product is of type **"variable"**,
- And you set a **price on the parent product** (yes, the one Woo hides),
- Then this plugin will **automatically copy it to all variations** (price & sale price).

## ðŸ”§ How to use
1. Set your product type to **variable**.
2. Define your **attributes and variations** as usual.
3. Set your price on the **main product** (top of the page).
4. Save the product â€” done.

> ðŸ¤– Behind the curtain: this hooks into `save_post_product` and updates all variation meta.

## ðŸ§ª Why?
WooCommerce forces you to set prices individually for every variation,  
even when they are all identical. Want to bulk-edit? Thatâ€™ll be **$79/year**, thanks.  
So yeah. _Fuck it._

French bugs. Real irony. Less bullshit.
